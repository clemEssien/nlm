PMA Induces SnoN Proteolysis and CD61 Expression through an Autocrine Mechanism
Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, also called PMA, is a small molecule that activates protein kinase C and functions to differentiate hematologic lineage cells. However, the mechanism of PMA-induced cellular differentiation is not fully understood. We found that PMA triggers global enhancement of protein ubiquitination in K562, a myelogenous leukemia cell line and one of the enhanced-ubiquitination targets is SnoN, an inhibitor of the Smad signaling pathway. Our data indicated that PMA stimulated the production of Activin A, a cytokine of the TGF-Î² family. Activin A then activated the phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3. In consequence, SnoN is ubiquitinated by the APC
