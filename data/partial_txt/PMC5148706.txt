Intersectin scaffold proteins and their role in cell signaling and endocytosis
Intersectins (ITSNs) are a family of multi-domain proteins involved in regulation of diverse cellular pathways. These scaffold proteins are well known for regulating endocytosis but also play important roles in cell signaling pathways including kinase regulation and Ras activation. ITSNs participate in several human cancers, such as neuroblastomas and glioblastomas, while its downregulation is associated with lung injury. Alterations in ITSN expression have been found in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down Syndrome and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Binding proteins for ITSNs include endocytic regulatory factors, cytoskeleton related proteins (i.e. actin or dynamin), signaling proteins as well as herpes virus proteins. This review will summarize recent studies on ITSNs, highlighting the importance of these scaffold proteins in the aforementioned processes.
